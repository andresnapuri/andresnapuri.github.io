I am currently a first year PhD student in Linguistics at New York University. M.Sc. in Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Assistant Professor of Amazonian Linguistics at UNMSM. Visiting Scholar at the University of Oxford, and Visiting Researcher at the Humboldt Universit√§t, Berlin. My research focuses on phonological aspects of Amazonian languages. I have also conducted ethnolinguistic, ethnographic, and grammatical studies with members of Amazonian societies, like Bora (Boran) and Ashaninka (Arawakan)

Some of my previous work on Amazonian languages
======
In recent years, together with a group of colleagues, we have edited life stories of indigenous leaders. In both cases, these are studies in predominantly oral Amazonian languages, with very little written tradition in their language. Both books include introductory studies, as well as a bilingual edition in Ashaninka-Spanish, and Bora-Spanish, respectively. Thanks to an institutional agreement, both books are now freely available at the following links:

These studies attribute authorship to the indigenous leaders interviewed. They are also highly valuable projects because they offer marginalised voices a platform in academia and among the general public. They also provide a space for discussion and growth between Linguistics and other social science disciplines, such as Anthropology.
