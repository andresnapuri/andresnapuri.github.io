I am currently a first year PhD student in Linguistics at NYU. M.Sc. in Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Assistant Professor of Amazonian Linguistics at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru. I was Visiting Scholar at the University of Oxford, and Visiting Fellow at the Humboldt Universität, Berlin. My research focuses on phonological aspects of Amazonian languages. I have also conducted ethnolinguistic, ethnographic, and grammatical studies with members of Amazonian societies, like Bora (Boran) and Ashaninka (Arawakan)

Some of my previous work on Amazonian languages
======
In recent years, together with a group of colleagues, [Luis Andrade Ciudad](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/profesor/luis-andrade-ciudad), [Susana Frisancho](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/profesor/susana-frisancho-hidalgo), and [Enrique Delgado](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/profesor/guillermo-delgado-ramos), we have edited life stories of indigenous leaders. In both cases, these are studies in predominantly oral Amazonian languages, with very little written tradition in their language. Both books include introductory studies, as well as a bilingual edition in Ashaninka-Spanish, and Bora-Spanish, respectively. Thanks to an institutional agreement, both books are now freely available at the following links:

These studies attribute authorship to the indigenous leaders interviewed. They are also highly valuable projects because they offer marginalised voices a platform in academia and among the general public. They also provide a space for discussion and growth between Linguistics and other social science disciplines, such as Anthropology.

Some recent projects
======
1. Currently, with [Margarita Jara](https://www.unlv.edu/people/margarita-jara), we are editing a dossier in the journal [_Letras_](https://revista.letras.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/le/convocatoria-2025) on Amazonian Spanish. This volume is scheduled to be published in December 2025.
1. I will be participating as a guest speaker at the 10th CILE in the city of Arequipa in October 2025. 
1. A manuscript on coalescence and epenthesis in Mazamari Ashaninka (Arawakan), in collaboration with colleagues of UNMSM, has been accepted for publication in _Onomázein_ for the second quarter of 2027. Ask me for the preprint!
1. In collaboration with [CRC 1412](https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/projects/a09/) at Humboldt Universität, and with colleagues at [UNIFSLB](https://www.unibagua.edu.pe), we are conducting a research on the double possessive in Spanish in contact with Awajun (Chicham).
